# 👁️ Status Update 04.10.2025
Wexort is officially not a script for Fling Things and People anymore. There's other project called [Tokra Script](https://github.com/sladostrastnik/TokraScript) that currently replaces Wexort forever. Developers aren't planning to remake Wexort once again and make it work due to it's irreparable incompatibilities and malfunctions. Thanks for everything <3


# Wexort
**Wexort** — project made by **Sladostrastnik** and **4art** and inspired by **gabescripts**. It was supossed to be script hub for some games on **Roblox**, but at the time of release it was working only in **Fling Things and People** by **Horomori**. In result it became the biggest and strongest script hub. It's development took almost 1 year and was discontinued 2 times.

# Developers
**4art** — first main developer. Made most of powerful HvH and fun features.  
**Sladostrastnik** — second main developer. Code proofreader and visual editor. Improved and expanded some features. Author of code's protection.  
**VHCK** — helped 4art with improving main HvH feature (blobman) and kick detection.  
**Iven** — head sponsor. Sped up the development process and advertised hub everywhere possible.  
**Locality** — suggested some functions and helped with protection by improving it alot.  

# Known
As the biggest hub;  
As most advanced hub;  
As best scripters tool;  
For strongest HvH features;  
For strongest Blobman;  
For big promises;  
For expert developers  

# First try: Fail
**4art** and **Sladostrastnik** wanted to develop a script for their favorite game (Fling Things and People) and release it after. The project was discontinued right few days before release because of **kick grab patch**. Half of Wexort functions were working based on kick grab mechanic, so it was pointless to release it. First version of Wexort was very raw and had bad user interface.

# Second try: Rise and Fall
Once again **4art** and **Sladostrastnik** united and were serious about the next try. Slado decided to try again because of **Elysium** success and desire to earn money. The hub was progessively becoming big and best for HvH during the development. 4art was adding a lot of fun and good stuff to the hub and even united with other hub developer (VHS by VHCK) and they discovered the best blobman kick at that time. Wexort community server grew and it was ready to get released, but the release was very delayed because of Slado's decide to develop custom protection for hub because it also got paid Premium features. In beginning of summer Slado corrected half of code and built protection (like anti-crack) almost only himself. Hub was almost discontinued because of long time and huge demotivation coming from other hub developers, but Iven and Locality forced development to speed up: Iven sponsored project by buying **Luraph Obfuscator** for 40$ and Locality gave a lot of features to Slado to add them into Wexort.  
Slado released Wexort and started getting premium customers very quick. Everything was too good, but some disagreements occurred between the developers. 4art and Slado decided to remake Blobman tab due to it's complexity for normal users and they were slowly starting to do it. Someone known as **Flashh** caused blobman exploits to get patched and Slado threw everything away like it's pointless to continue. 4art and Slado discontinued Wexort once again and were done with it. Because of the patch Slado and 4art couldn't add a lot of new blobman exploits they discovered: multi-grab, multi-blobman, better anti-blobman, blobman destroyer and etc.  
Wexort community server got deleted after fail to clean the script from patched stuff and personal argument between developers.
